Ideas for further development
-----------------------------

- Make the filtering and ordering of the listed peaks more intelligent, so that it lists the ones you are likely to be able to see from the specified latitube and longitude.
- Create a graphic to show the distances and bearings of the peaks which can be used with a compass to orientate the mobile device.
- Use the mobile device's inbuilt compass to align the graphic.
- Present the names of the peaks on a camera overlay for an augmented reality experience.
